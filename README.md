LambdaHub
Spring â€˜24 Project Proposal

Vision
The Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity currently uses many different applications including, but not limited to Messenger, Gmail, Phone Messaging, and the EHZ Calendar to organize its affairs. This includes releasing Google forms, announcements, upcoming events, and general communication, all split into different apps, mixed with personal communications as well. With LambdaHub, we aim to consolidate these platforms into one, streamlined and easy-to-use environment that will reduce confusion and vastly improve communication within the fraternity. Building the app from scratch, we plan to implement some foundational key features, including an announcement board, driver queue, and calendar. The officers of the fraternity will be granted admin access to the app, giving them the access to add personalized announcements, and calendar events, and grant privileges to other members within the app.
